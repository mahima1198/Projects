<br/><br/>
Core Values
<br/><br/>
The core values of our organization are those values we hold which form the foundation on which we perform work and conduct ourselves.  We have an entire universe of values, but some of them are so primary, so important to us that through out the changes in society, government, politics, and technology they are STILL the core values we will abide by.  In an ever-changing world, core values are constant.  Core values are not descriptions of the work we do or the strategies we employ to accomplish our mission.  The values underlie our work, how we interact with each other, and which strategies we employ to fulfill our mission.  The core values are the basic elements of how we go about our work.  They are the practices we should be using every day in everything we do.

History of Packrat Comics
<br/><br/>
The dream began when Jamie was a child, escaping into the world of superheroes where good and evil were as clear as black and white contrasted by a world full of brilliant vibrant colors.    From Thor to Batman, Justice League to the Avengers, the only limit to their continued adventures outside of the comic book was one’s imagination.  Finding new comics in his youth was a difficult task, but fortunately he had a family of uncles and brothers who understood his pleasure and shared with him their treasured collections.
<br/><br/>
As time went by the only place he could find a comic in his small hometown of Hilliard, Ohio was at a gas station on a small rack behind the hot dog roller. Knowing his enjoyment of comics was not limited to him, but many friends and family members, Jamie dreamt of providing a place where comics were the main-course and not the side-dish.   With a dream in his heart, a dime in his pocket and youth on his side, he opened Packrat Comics in 1993. The shop endured many of the trials and tribulations of the 1990’s market place, and has continued to thrive ever since.
After the birth of his first child in 1995, Jamie came to the striking realization that the comic industry is realistically only one generation from extinction.  By not capturing the youth today, the industry would be limited in the future. Since then, Packrat Comics has changed the focus from servicing of the individual, to providing an environment for the family.  With every event, community outreach program and business relationship, Packrat Comics has kept the family focus in mind.
Since 1993, Packrat Comics has worked continuously to provide a fun family environment, growing and changing to meet the needs of our customers and community.
