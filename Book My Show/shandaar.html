<font size="3" color="grey" face="comic sans ms">
A big fat ''Shaandaar'' Indian wedding, which is actually a business merger between two of the biggest business families of India, is happening at an exotic castle in Europe. Mrs. Kamla Arora, the grandmother of the Arora family, the sole owner of the billion-dollar business and the property, has planned their wedding. Kamla Arora is a shrew, and treats everyone like her servants including her three sons, Bipin, Vipul and Vinay. Mr.Fandwani, the groom's father, is a loud Sindhi businessman who is the counter to Kamla Arora: The Fandwanis dress in gold, accessorize in gold and if it was possible, they'd drink and eat gold. <br>

Set against the backdrop of the Shaandaar wedding, is a love triangle between (our protagonists) Aliya, Jagjinder Joginder and Bipin (Aliya's father). Bipin believes that there's no guy who will be good enough for his daughter, while Aliya is a dreamer, but her dreams are whacked out and Jagjinder Joginder is a doer, he can make anything happen! And for obvious reasons, Bipin hates Jagjinder Joginder.<br>

The journey of Aliya, Jagjinder Joginder and Bipin in the chaotic and lavish wedding is the story of Shaandaar. It's a fairy tale love story that everyone has always dreamt of!<br><br><br> </font>
