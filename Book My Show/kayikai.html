Ramayana, the era old epic has been narrated to us quite a few times. This chronicle has a million undiscovered truths and tales that help the contemporary human to achieve salvation.
The rationale of this play is to unfold the character of Kaikeyi in an entirely disparate outlook and give justice to the much unheard side of her story.
Traditionally her character is perceived as that of a the desperado. However, here a very different allegory is presented. Here she has been represented as a quixotic and visionary woman. The manifesto was not to give the royal throne to her son Bharata or to be honoured as ''Raajmaata''or her highness. The manifesto was to figure out the path to protect the highest clan of humans, the Aryans from a demonic reign.
