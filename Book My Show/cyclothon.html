Bike fever has swept Hyderabad and the city is all set to celebrate all things cycling with the Hyderabad Cyclothon 2015. This is being held for the first time in Hyderabad and is a mixture of competitive and fun races and rides. The event allows you to push yourself to the utmost or enjoy the city's scenery on the ORR stretch with long, leisurely rides, as you cheer the competitive cyclists. This is an all inclusive event that aims to bring cyclists across all age groups, gender, abilities and skills to support the cause of cycling, road safety and healthy, green environs in the city. 

There will be the following categories:
- 50 KM Competitive Open Timed Race for Men and Women 
One of the key highlights of the India Cyclothon, the competitive timed race will be a showcase of the passion of seasoned cyclists. A test of power, endurance and skill. The race is divided into 2 categories: Masters and Juniors across categories for men and women.<br>
- 25 KM Challenge Ride
Open to all types of cyclists seasoned and amateur, individual or a part of corporate team. This event is a great way to challenge yourself or advocate team spirit.<br>
- 10 KM Family Fun Ride
Open to beginners who are not so regular cyclists to get on their bikes, who can now embark on an easy 10 km ride and also raise money for a cause or pedal for road users' safety and green environment. You can ride in costumes and promote the message of 'bikers' safety'.<br>
- 2 KM Kids Ride
This is the perfect event to get kids excited about the sport of cycling. Get them all to the stadium and watch them ride away. Here, each kid is a winner.<br>
- 2 KM Ride for Specially Abled Persons
