Inspired by a few real life instances, Lakeerein showcases a collation of stories and numerous poems by litterateur Gulzaar on-stage. It offers a peek into the lives of people divided by common history and culture, whose lives got affected by lines drawn on a piece of paper. The show encompasses the journey of the last sixty years of Indo-Pak relations with stories of hope, despair, passion and redemption. The show is a tribute to the resilience of human spirit and shared values nurtured over centuries of common co-existence. Gulzar Saab draws from his vast personal experience on this theme and its consequences on the lives of its people.

L.O.C. is a story set against the 1965 skirmish, involving two friends pitted against each other across the border in those troubled times. It is a telling comment on the division of people across the border, with common roots.

Peer Sahab is based on his conversations in 1998 with eminent Indian journalist Kuldeep Nayyar who was born in Sialkot of undivided India, about the presence of a Peer in their life, someone who oversaw the passage of this family in turbulent times. It provides a rare insight into the commonality of cultural values shared by the people of India.

Over deals with the life across our porous borders, about soldiers and infiltrators leading a life that is very different than the frontlines of newspapers suggest. It depicts the plight of our borders seen through the eyes of a film crew in recent times. Funny yet poignant, the story puts in perspective the real and perceived notions of borders and its life with telling effect.
Narrated with trademark humour and interspersed with profoundly poetic lines, the play is a fascinating showcase of one of the greatest raconteurs in India.
