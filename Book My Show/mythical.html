<font size="3" color="grey" face="comic sans ms">
'The Mystical Forest'', Sadhya's new contemporary dance production explores life within the forest. The production, choreographed by Santosh Nair, draws from the dance vocabulary of Mayurbhanj Chhau (a traditional dance form from Orissa) with strong grounded movements and contemporary interpretation.
Varied experiences, activities, emotions, rituals and relationships of the inhabitants find expression in the production. Its music, choreography, movement, lights and costumes all attempt to bring to the audiences the natural and simple life of its inhabitants - a complete world of its own, which at times is apprehensive of any outside disturbances.
The production, without being too outright makes one think - if only we could let this world (of the inhabitants of the forest) be as it is: simple, innocent, surviving in their natural habitat, and let nothing disturb this natural existence.</font><br><br><br>
